<p>每隔一段时间或遇到不开心的时候，我都会从笔记中把Naval的这段话翻出来温习一遍。提醒自己：我们不过是一颗旋转小岩石上的一只小猴子...我们的存在渺小的不足挂齿...而现在的生活就是我们的所有，那么，还有什么理由还活在痛苦之中呢？</p>

<h2 id="monkey-on-spinning-rock-naval-ravikant">Monkey on Spinning Rock---Naval Ravikant</h2>
<p>“If you study even the smallest bit of science, you will realize that, for all practical purposes, we are nothing. We’re basically monkeys on a small rock orbiting a small, backwards star in a huge galaxy, which is in an absolutely staggeringly gigantic universe, which itself may be part of a gigantic multiverse.</p>
<p>“This universe has been around for probably 10 billion years or more, and will be around for tens of billion years afterwards. So your existence, my existence, is just infinitesimal. It is like a firefly blinking once in the night. Nothing that we do lasts. Eventually you will fade, your works will fade, your children will fade, your thoughts will fade, this planet will fade, the sun will fade . . . it will all be gone.</p>
<p>“There are entire civilizations that we remember now with just one or two words like ‘Sumerian’ or ‘Mayan.’ Do you know any Sumerians or Mayans? Do you hold any of them in high regard or esteem? Have they outlived their natural lifespan somehow? No.</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe in an afterlife, then you [should realize] that this is such a short and precious life, it is really important that you don’t spend it being unhappy. There is no excuse for spending most of your life in misery. You’ve only got 70 years out of the 50 billion or however long the universe is going to be around.”</p>

<p>Second Sorted by me <a href="https://jamieliu.xyz/">Jamie Liu</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="value-your-time">Value Your Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be more conscious of what's a waste of your time</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The moment I figure out something is a waste of my time, I leave immediately.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking back now, Naval realizes most of his past business trips were a waste of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Business trips are almost never worth it.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Value your time, it's all you have.&quot;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Anytime you can trade money for time, you should, because time is the thing you'll run out of first.&quot;</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Naval recalls a tweet – “Not wanting something is as good as having it”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimalism is no longer required – what’s required is that your expectations to be just below your means</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“People who live below their expectations, enjoy a freedom people who are busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t afford.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t keep upgrading your lifestyle every time you make more money – try to live below what you’re earning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="less-emotion-and-anger">Less Emotion and Anger</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Anger hurts you, first and foremost.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;We didn't evolve to be angry all the time.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;The anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at somebody.&quot;</strong>(Buddist saying)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would Naval tell his 23 year old self?</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I wish I had done all the same things but with less emotion and less anger.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="happiness">Happiness</h2>
<h3 id="it-wont-make-you-happy">It won't make you happy</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Anything you wanted in your life - whether it was a car, wether it was a girl, or whether it was money - when you got it, a year later, you were back to zero. You brain had hedonically adapted to it, and you were looking for the next thing.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="not-happy-not-smart">Not Happy? Not Smart</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;If you're smart and capable, you should be able to figure out how to be happy. Otherwise, you're not that smart.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="happiness-is-a-choice">Happiness is a choice</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Happiness is somthing we can learn.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The first step to be happier, is to believe you can be happier.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Just like fitness can be a choice, health can be a choice, nutrition can be a choice, and working hard and making money can be a choice, <strong>happiness is also a choice</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uncondition-yourself">Uncondition Yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A big habit that Naval is working on</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I'm trying to turn off his monkey mind.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;People are constantly judging everything that they see. They'are playing back movies of things happened yesterday. They're living in fatansy worlds of what's going to happen tomorrow. They're just pulled out of base reality. Actually it's very bad for your happiness.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The mind should be a servant and a tool, not a master. It's not something that should be controlling me and driving me 24/7.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;You can uncondition yourself. You can untrain yourself. It's just hard.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit-your-desires">Limit Your Desires</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Desire is suffering.&quot;(Buddha)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Desire to me is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>When you're unhappy about something, just look for the underlying desire that isn't being fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Happiness is clouded by unlimited desires. Because of this, limit the amount of desire you have.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Pick your one overwhelming desire - it's okay to suffer over that one.  But on all the other desires, let them go so you can be calm and peaceful and relaxed.&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-era-of-too-much-abundance">The Era of Too Much Abundance</h2>
<h3 id="heres-the-problem">Here's the Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;The Human brain is not designed to absorb all of the world's breaking news and 24/7 emergencies, injected straight into the skull with clickbait headlines. If you pay attention to that stuff, even if you have a sound mind and body, it will eventually drive you insane.&quot;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;You have social statisticians, scientists, and researchers in lab coats - literally the best minds our generation - figuring out how to addict you to the news. And if you fall for it, if you get addicted, you brain will destroyed.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heres-the-solution">Here's the Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;We are overexposed to everthing. The way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic; it is to retreat from society. There's too much society everywhere you go. You have society in your phone, society in your pocket, society in you ears...It's socializing you and programming everyone. <strong>The one solution is to turn it off.</strong>&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Socail Media: &quot;This is the desease of social media - everybody is getting their 5 seconds of fame and becoming a celebrity...but celebrities are the most miserable people in the world.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aviod-addictions">Aviod Addictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;In a first-world society, success and failure is much more about how you control, manage, and break addictions than it is about going out and doing something.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html">Supplementary：Life is Short by Paul Graham</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;One byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;We have to make a conscious effort to avoid addcitions - to stand outside ourselves and ask: <strong>is this how I want to be spending my time?</strong>&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
