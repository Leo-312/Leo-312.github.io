<hr>
<h2 id="value-your-time">Value Your Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be more conscious of what's a waste of your time</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The moment I figure out something is a waste of my time, I leave immediately.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking back now, Naval realizes most of his past business trips were a waste of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Business trips are almost never worth it.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Value your time, it's all you have.&quot;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Anytime you can trade money for time, you should, because time is the thing you'll run out of first.&quot;</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Naval recalls a tweet ‚Äì ‚ÄúNot wanting something is as good as having it‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimalism is no longer required ‚Äì what‚Äôs required is that your expectations to be just below your means</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúPeople who live below their expectations, enjoy a freedom people who are busy upgrading their lifestyles can‚Äôt afford‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>Don‚Äôt keep upgrading your lifestyle every time you make more money ‚Äì try to live a notch below what you‚Äôre earning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="break-addictions">Break Addictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;In a first-world society, success and failure is much more about how you control, manage, and break addictions than it is about going out and doing something.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html">SupplementaryÔºöLife is Short by Paul Graham</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;We have to make a conscious effort to advoid addcitions - to stand outside ourselves and ask: is this how I want to be spending my time?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="less-emotion-and-anger">Less Emotion and Anger</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Anger hurts you, first and foremost.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;We didn't evolve to be angry all the time.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;The anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at somebody.&quot;</strong>(Buddist saying)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would Naval tell his 23 year old self?</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I wish I had done all the same things but with less emotion and less anger.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="happiness">Happiness</h2>
<h3 id="it-wont-make-you-happy">It won't make you happy</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Anything you wanted in your life - whether it was a car, wether it was a girl, or whether it was money - when you got it, a year later, you were back to zero. You brain had hedonically adapted to it, and you were looking for the next thing.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="not-happy-not-smart">Not Happy? Not Smart</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;If you're smart and capable, you should be able to figure out how to be happy. Otherwise, you're not that smart.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="happiness-is-a-choice">Happiness is a choice</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Happiness is somthing we can learn.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The first step to be happier, is to believe you can be happier.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Just like fitness can be a choice, health can be a choice, nutrition can be a choice, and working hard and making money can be a choice, <strong>happiness is also a choice</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uncandition-yourself">Uncandition Yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;In my mind, the mind should be a servant and a tool, not a master. It's not something that should be controlling me and driving me 24/7. I think it's actually bad for your happiness.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;I think you can uncandition yourself. You can untrain yourself. It's just hard.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit-your-desires">Limit Your Desires</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Desire is suffering.&quot;(Buddha)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Desire to me is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>When you're unhappy about something, just look for the underlying desire that isn't being fulfilled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Happiness is clouded by unlimited desires. Because of this, limit the amount of desire you have.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Pick your one overwhelming desire - it's okay to suffer over that one.  But on all the other desires, let them go so you can be calm and peaceful and relaxed.&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-era-of-too-much-abundance">The Era of Too Much Abundance</h2>
<h3 id="heres-the-problem">Here's the Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;The Human brain is not designed to absorb all of the world's breaking news and 24/7 emergencies, injected straight into the skull with clickbait headlines. If you pay attention to that stuff, even if you have a sound mind and body, it will eventually drive you insane.&quot;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;You have social statisticians, scientists, and researchers in lab coats - literally the best minds our generation - figuring out how to addict you to the news. And if you fall for it, if you get addicted, you brain will destroyed.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heres-the-solution">Here's the Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot; We are overexposed to everthing. The way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic; it is to retreat from society. There's too much society everywhere you go. You have society in your phone, society in your pocket, society in you ears...It's socializing you and programming everyone. <strong>The one solution is to turn it off.</strong>&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Socail Media: &quot;This is the desease of social media - everybody is getting their 5 seconds of fame and becoming a celebrity...but celebrities are the most miserable people in the world.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
